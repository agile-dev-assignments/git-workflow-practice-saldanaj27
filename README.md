This article is interesting because it shows a clear need for software engineers in the United States. I also learned that around 400k computer science majors graduate every year. I assumed this number would be larger than this. I also realize that a lot of these graduates are not sufficiently prepared enough to handle computer science roles. There is a clear need to restructure how computer science majors are taught.
